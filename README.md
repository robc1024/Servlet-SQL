# Servlet-SQL

This personal project's goal is to understand how front and back-end systems interact and communicate in the form of a basic web application. In addition, I hoped to become more familiar with multiple development tools and environments, as well as get in some practice with creating SQL queries.

Dev Tools:
 - Eclipse EE IDE (v4.13)
   - Java Runtime Environment (v1.8)
   - Java Database Connectivity (4.2)
 - SQL Server Express (v14.0)
 - SQL Server Managment Studio (v18.4)
 - HeidiSQL (v10.2)
